# 👨‍💻 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi! I'm a software developer (MSc with a final thesis in data science + a degree in web development applications) with experience across several academic and professional domains:

- ⚙️ **Back-End**: Recently acquired knowledge in SpringBoot and MySQL as databases, both during my CFGS studies and through self-learning.
- 📊 **Data Science & Machine Learning**: Hands-on experience from my MSc degree and professional projects.
- 🎨 **Front-End**: Learned during my Software Development degree (CFGS DAW - Web Application Development, currently in my final year).
- 🧠 **Algorithms and Programming Competitions**: Achieved good results in the regional "ProgramaMe" competition and during the first-year programming course at UPC.
- 📚 **LaTeX Projects**: Extensive use of LaTeX, especially for high-quality typographic documents, such as my Master's thesis.

Below, you'll find a categorized list of my projects with details on the area, programming languages, and description.
